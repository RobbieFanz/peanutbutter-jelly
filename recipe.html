            <h3>Juliana:</h3>
            <p>I have to say, I'm amazed. I've had these ingredients just sitting around for months and until now I've never known a use for them! I made this sandwich a few days ago, but I am wondering
                what I should do about the blisters on my hands due to the gloves. There were no instruction to take them off afterwards so I've been spending my days wearing them, and it's becoming a
                little concerning. I am also still a little confused as to why my brother didn't enjoy the sandwich, as it was not an optional instruction, after telling him this he reminded me (rudely) that he has
                a peanut allergy. Is it true that this would stop him from enjoying it? Anyway, I've been in the hospital with him for a while now and I'm wondering if that instruction still applies? Should I show
                him the article? Do you think that would make a difference? I did bring the sandwich with me in case, thanks in advance! It also doesn't specify how the jelly should be applied, so I used my
                better judgment and used my hand. Overall, I'd love if you went into more detail next time, maybe a few hundred steps to be sure
            </p>
